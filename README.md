HarvardX's Data Science Certificate Program

This repository contains code written for the Data Science certificate program on HarvardX. This program ranges from basic probability and statistical inference to machine learning, using the programming language R and the IDE RStudio. The DataCamp website was utilized primarily for the course fundamentals, so only some code will be reproduced here. The courses are as follows: 

1. R Basics
2. Visualization (using ggplot2)
3. Probability
4. Inference and Modeling
5. Productivity Tools (git, GitHub, Unix, and R markdown)
6. Wrangling
7. Linear Regression
8. Machine Learning
9. Capstone
