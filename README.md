HarvardX's Data Science Certificate Program

This repository contains code written for the Data Science certificate program on HarvardX. This program ranges from basic probability and statistical inference to machine learning, using the programming language R and the IDE RStudio. The DataCamp website was utilized primarily for the course fundamentals, so only some code will be reproduced here. Note that no code is included for course 5 (Productivity Tools), since this covered basics of Unix and git and did not involve examples in the R environment. The courses are as follows: 

1. R Basics
2. Visualization (using ggplot2)
3. Probability
4. Inference and Modeling
5. Productivity Tools (git, GitHub, Unix, and R markdown)
6. Wrangling
7. Linear Regression
8. Machine Learning
9. Capstone

The capstone course at the end of the sequence is a hands-on application of machine learning to the MovieLens dataset. The goal is to build a recommendation system based on 10 million observations of user-movie ratings that achieves minimal error on predictions. This explores data import, cleaning, and a variety of machine learning algorithms, though simple linear and ridge regression are predominant.
